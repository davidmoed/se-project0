This article was particularly interesting to me because it showcases an interesting and external part of the software development process. As software development has progressed it is interesting how the "validation" part of the process has spawned an entire industry that works in tandem with project developers themselves. The fact that Google alone is paying out almost _3 million dollars_ for outside researchers to help ensure that their products are secure, shows the enormous emphasis put on validation that spans beyond the company itself.

Larger companies are well known for outsourcing this pivotal task, in addition to doing internal inquiries, but it is interesting to consider whether we will start seeing a larger industry develop as smaller and smaller companies put a premium on security.
